          <p>
            When I was job hunting in 2019, I visited various company websites,
            and I came across one that seemed outdated. That was my initial
            impression of the company.
          </p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>
            After joining the company, my colleagues and I conducted a simple
            analysis to determine if our website was serving its intended
            purpose. Our findings revealed that: <span class="note">(data from WH sales and marketing department by 2020)</span>
          </p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                80% of our sales team believed that we were unable to
                efficiently expand our user base.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our primary pre-purchase user touch points were referrals from:
                <ol>
                  <li>Existing users (77%)</li>
                  <li>Sales warm and cold calls (23%)</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

              >Visual Objects</a
            >, a digital marketing platform, reports that 76% of consumers check
            a company's online presence before visiting in person. This is why
            we have decided to update our website with the following project
            goals in mind:
          </p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ol>
              <li>Increase website traffic by 10% by the end of 2021.</li>
              <li>Improve potential user touch points on the website by 5%.</li>
            </ol>

         <!-- Section 2: Define -->
         <div id="section_2_define"> 
          <h6>Define</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>We started by conducting user surveys to gather information and identify opportunities from both existing and potential customers. Our sales and marketing team recommended that we include 70% of existing customers and 30% of potential customers in the surveys.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>The results of the surveys were clear:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ol>
              <li>Participants described our website as <span class="bold">old (87%), rough (54%), and hazy (47%)</span>.</li>
            <li>62.5% of participants found it difficult to understand the message and locate the information they needed.</li>
            <li>43% of participants couldn't find any significant difference that set us apart from our competitors.</li>
            <li>37% of participants didn't take any further actions after browsing our website.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>Based on these results, we made the following hypotheses:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div><ul><li>Improving our branding recognition will increase customers' interest.</li><li>Using plain language and easy-to-follow content will help customers find the information they need and encourage them to learn more about our company.</li></ul></div>

        <div class="section_dot"></div>
        <!-- Section 3: Solution #1 -->
        <div id="section_3_solution_1">
          <h6>Solution #1:  Easy-to-follow content</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>We conducted an analysis of the types of users who approach us the most and their primary needs and motivations. Here are the key findings:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Business owners/Top executives/Managers (51%):</span> These users approach us to see if our products fit into their company goals and what solutions we can provide.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Procurement managers (27%):</span> These users compare features and prices from different companies.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">IT (13%):</span> These users want to know whether our products can be integrated easily with theirs.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Actual product users (9%):</span> These users want to know about the product features and whether user support is approachable.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>Upon analysing the types of users that approach us the most, we discovered a substantial message gap between our current website's language and the needs of our users. The website's content is mainly written from a technical perspective, which has resulted in several challenges:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>It is difficult for non-IT people to understand the content.</li>
              <li>The website does not provide an adequate introduction to the features.</li>
              <li>New product lines have not been updated on the website yet.</li>
              <li>Users cannot see the larger picture of our products and services.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>To overcome this gap, we have introduced Simon Sinek's golden circle principle in our team. We understand that our message should start by telling our users "why" we do what we do, rather than just "what" we do. By focusing on our vision, we aim to create a more impactful message that resonates with our audience.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>To further evaluate our position, we conducted a SWOT analysis of our company:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>

          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>As the saying goes, "Unity is strength," and we are finally able to showcase our strengths by offering a complete, unique solution that delivers higher value than our competitors.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>By combining all of our products into a single platform, we provide the most comprehensive industrial cloud platform and risk control management solutions.</li>
              <li>We are able to support our customers in building their value chain and fostering effortless collaboration with their suppliers and customers on our platform.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>And our WHY? <span class="bold">We dedicate ourselves to helping our clients do the most impactful things</span>(supporting them to manage their company to be more eco-friendly) <span class="bold">with the least amount of costs</span>. And it drives us to continue innovating and providing unparalleled value to our clients.</p>

          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>To make our brand more memorable to customers and align it with our vision (our WHY), we are also considering rebranding. According to <a href="https://passionates.com/importance-of-brand-design/" class="project_linking" target="_blank">What is Brand Design and Why is it Important? by Passionate</a>, this can help us in the following ways:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase brand recognition, which is crucial since our survey found that 43% of respondents couldn't see any significant difference between our competitors and us.</li>
              <li>Increase value within our company, as it's important to understand our own value before conveying our message to customers effectively.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>Taking into account our leading services, we offer:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Green Product Management System: helping customers meet international environmental regulations and providing end-users with innocuous products.</li>
              <li>Manufacturing Execution System with Carbon Footprint Management System: helping customers calculate carbon emissions from their companies, factories, and suppliers.</li>
              <li>Green Book Platform: a platform for customers to upload their green information to strengthen their green supply chain.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>We want customers to think of our brand as:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>A green management advocate that is enthusiastic and positive.</li>
              <li>A trustworthy and reliable IT company.</li>
              <li>A sophisticated and subtle solution provider.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>To ensure brand consistency, we updated our business card and document templates. Our primary colour palette is:</p>

            <ul>

          <p>As a result, here is what we’ve achieved at the end of 2021:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <p class="underline">Project Goal #1 : Increased potential user touch points from the website by 5%.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>In fact, we were able to <span class="bold">increase potential user touch points from our website by 7%.</span></p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>And we found updating our business cards really helped us gain more attention as our sales are industriously doing cold calls and visiting potential customers in the frontline.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>By adding a website QR code to the business card, they can learn more about what we will provide through our website. Therefore, increasing the touchpoint.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <p class="underline">Project Goal #2 : Increasing website traffic by 10% at the end of 2021.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>As our marketing team reported, <span class="bold">we increased the website traffic by 6.7%.</span> And we line up some strategies we would want to try for the next round of the iteration. Here is what we have planned for 2022:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Engage more on social media. Moreover, we are planning to use a Line official account even to support our customers more immediately.</li>
              <li>Use content marketing. We have been in the green industry for almost 2 decades. We indeed have many things that we would like to share with our customers.</li>
              <li>Improve our SEO ranking by strengthening our website security, updating content regularly and connecting with other industry professionalism sites…etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>This project helped me have a much bigger picture of how to handle a project like that, learn to be more dependent on our teams and other resources, like our marketing and sales teams, and how to listen to them truly.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>To say the least, I very much enjoy doing this project. Not only was it the first project I owned, but I also learned and grown at literally every step of it.</p>
