          <p class="text_xl underline">Whatâ€™s the problem we aim to solve:</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>In Taiwan, the process of setting parameters for plastic injection is a highly skilled technique that heavily relies on personal experience. Unfortunately, this knowledge is often only stored in the master's memory and not systematically recorded and analysed on paper. As a result, it becomes difficult to pass on this knowledge and experience to future generations.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>With the number of young masters in this field decreasing and the older generation approaching retirement, it is increasingly urgent and necessary to find a way to preserve and pass on this valuable expertise.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>Our goal was to provide a way to systematically record and analyse the setting of injection parameters, and we aim to ensure that this valuable knowledge is not lost and can be shared effectively among generations.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="section_dot"></div>

        <!-- Section 3: User Research Analysis-->
        <div id="section_3_user_research_analysis">
          <h6>User Research Analysis</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>When I joined the team, the team had already developed a product plan to assist users in setting up injection parameters on machines. However, they were uncertain whether this approach was the most effective one, and that's where I came in.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>We used the very beginning prototype and let participants try it, and we found some issues:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>The parameters we provided were not sufficient for actual production situations since they needed to be adjusted depending on the site's environment. Our parameters could only serve as a starting point for users to fine-tune.</li>
              <li>The process of adjusting parameters is a valuable domain-know-how that is not easily recorded on paper or systematically. It is the most valuable information that can help users optimise the plastic injection process.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>We realised that if the product only provided parameter recommendations, it would not be attractive to users because:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Our parameters were theoretical recommendations that only served as a baseline value for users to start with.</li>
              <li>The users could not provide feedback or data to the system, making it difficult for our product to optimise based on user feedback and data input.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>To address these issues and make our product part of their daily tool and habit in their work, I introduced <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire" target="_blank" class="project_linking">the Nir Eyal Hook Model</a> to the team, which I believed could help us find our opportunity.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_03/project_03_hook_model.png" alt="Hook Model">
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>We identified that our product lacked investment steps in the Hook Model, and users might easily abandon it after finding alternative solutions. By using the Hook Model, we could design the product to have a more engaging user experience and retain users' attention.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>At that moment, we knew MoldMate Pro should not be just an Injection Parameter Generator but rather a valuable E-notebook, where users can not only generate injection parameters with ease and precision, but they can also record and share technical knowledge, reference previous work, and find suggested parameters.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>These additional features make MoldMate Pro a versatile tool that streamlines processes, reduces costs, and improves product quality, while also keeping users engaged and invested in the product.</p>

        <div id="section_4_ux_n_product_strategy">
          <h6>UX & Product Strategy</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>After having a solid idea of how we wanted our product to be, we started to define our product strategy.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_03/project_03_product_strategy.png" alt="Product Strategy">
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>We also use How Might We statement as a problem statement that is framed in a way that encourages ideation and creative thinking. And here are 4 statements that we use:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>How might we streamline the process for field personnel to access real-time advice on parameter tuning during production?</li>
              <li>How might we improve the standardisation and information available during parameter setting to enable easier production of standardised products?</li>
              <li>How might we capture and store relevant processing parameters and data during the trial molding process as a reference for future set-ups?</li>
              <li>How might we create a knowledge-sharing platform for personnel to easily access and refer to solutions, enabling more efficient transfer of manufacturing experience?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>With these ideas in mind, we created a very simple persona for three of our primary users.</p>

          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>For the first version, our main priority was to create a valuable E-notebook. This E-notebook would allow users to easily and accurately generate injection parameters. In addition, users could record and share technical knowledge, refer back to previous work, and access suggested parameters.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>To achieve this goal, we decided to release a free version of our product. The primary focus of this version was to generate suggested parameters and enable users to create projects where they could record their findings and provide feedback throughout the production process.</p>

          <p>Our second and third versions of the product build upon the must-have features of the first version by including additional nice-to-have features. These new features enhance the user experience and make our product even more complete.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>Some of the features included in these versions are the basic signup workflow, which makes it easier for users to create an account and get started. Additionally, we added the ability for users to invite and share with other members, making collaboration easier and more efficient.</p>

          <h6>Building Design System</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>As the outsourced product designer, my primary task was to create a prototype that would soon undergo user testing. However, before doing so, I recognised the importance of preparing handoff documents for other core members of the team. At this stage, the team did not have any in-house designers, and I knew that this would be critical for future designers to take over the project more seamlessly.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>To ensure that the design would be consistent and that knowledge sharing would be more accessible, I decided to create a design system. This system would allow for a more structured approach to design and enable everyone on the team to work together effectively. By doing this, we could ensure that all future designs would remain consistent, regardless of who was working on the project.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>I began by developing a style guide. The style guide acted as a comprehensive reference point for all design elements, including typography, colour palettes, iconography, and UI components. This ensured that all team members were working from the same guidelines and that the design remained cohesive throughout the project.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>

          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>Next, I developed design templates that could be easily adapted and applied to different areas of the project. This included templates for landing pages, user flows, and interactive elements such as buttons and forms.</p>

          <p>Overall, I'm incredibly proud of the product our team has developed. Our goal was to address the pain points experienced by operators and mold tryout specialists in the plastic injection molding and tooling industry, and I believe we've done just that.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>By reducing the time and material costs associated with parameter setting and adjusting, while improving quality control and standardisation, we've created a product that has the potential to revolutionise the industry and improve efficiency for factories around the world.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>While the time limit of the contract prevented me from conducting usability testing and measuring success metrics with the team, I'm confident that the product we've designed will meet the needs of our users and contribute to their success if the team keep refining the product and always thinking about our users.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>This project was a valuable learning experience for me as an outsourced product designer and consultant. I was able to collaborate effectively with the team and lead the development of a design system from scratch, which I'm particularly proud of.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>Looking ahead, I'm excited to see the product in action. I'm confident that this product will make a positive impact on the industry and improve the lives of those who rely on it.</p>
