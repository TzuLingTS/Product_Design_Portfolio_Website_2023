          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>Light MES is a cost-effective solution for factories looking to begin their digital transformation journey. One of its key features is real-time reporting, where operators are responsible for reporting the current production status on the shop floor. This provides increased accuracy and transparency in production processes.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>The implementation of Light MES leads to a paperless environment and digitisation of factory operations, resulting in improved efficiency and real-time updates.</p>

        <div id="section_2_challenge">
          <h6>Challenge</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>In 2020, we launched the first version of Light MES, but our team faced challenges in increasing and retaining our user base. We identified several problems, including:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>The difficulty of onboarding new users and integrating our features into their daily workflows.</li>
              <li>The transition rate to paid plans remained low, which negatively impacted our business.</li>
              <li>Users also showed a low interest in new features, further adding to our challenges.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>To address these issues, we conducted user surveys and interviews to gain insights into how our users felt about our product. The feedback we received indicated that:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>55% of users felt that the product overloaded them.</li>
              <li>35% of users found it somewhat complicated, particularly for senior users who lacked confidence in digital tools.</li>
              <li>30% of users found it easy to get lost in the multiple steps required to complete tasks.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>We also discovered that our current feature, originally designed for clocking in and out and recording tasks performed in a factory, did not align with our desired user flow of reporting real-time production line status.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>As a result, we needed to redesign our features to better meet our users' needs and improve their experience with Light MES.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section_dot"></div>
        <div><span class="dot">&#183 &#183 &#183</span></div>
        <div class="section_dot"></div>
        <!-- Section 3: Research & Analysis-->
        <div id="section_3_research_n_analysis">
          <h6>Research & Analysis</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>To better understand the differences between the original use and the current use of the feature, we conducted a comparison analysis. The table below outlines the key differences between the original use and the current use of the feature by operators:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_comparison_analysis.png" alt="Comparison Analysis">
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>By analyzing these differences, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of how the feature was originally intended to be used and how it was currently being used. This analysis highlighted the need to make significant changes to the feature in order to better align it with the needs of our users and improve their overall experience with the product.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>After analysing our findings and user research, we created a user journey map to visualize the issues in the current user flow.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_current_journey_map.png" alt="Current User Journey Map">
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>Based on our user research, we identified four key priority issues that need to be addressed:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Redundant data entry:</span> Users have to fill out a form with a lot of repetitive information when updating and adding new production statuses, including the manufacturing order number, machine and production line numbers and names, production status, and starting and ending times of the status. However, the only information they really need to input is the status and a double-check of the time.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Unnecessary time logging:</span> Users are required to log in with starting and ending times when updating and adding new production statuses, but since it's a real-time status report, is it really necessary?</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Illogical status connections:</span> The system automatically adds the ending time to the previous status when users update the following production status with only the starting time of the status. However, if users try to edit the prior status's ending time, it will also affect the starting time of the following status. This can cause confusion, and users need to have more control over the data.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Complicated interface:</span> The current user interface is too complicated, with too many options and buttons, making it difficult for users to navigate and complete tasks efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section_dot"></div>
        <div><span class="dot">&#183 &#183 &#183</span></div>

        <!-- Section 4: Opportunity -->
        <div id="section_4_opportunity">
          <h6>Opportunity</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>To summarise our findings, we have created a UX Problem Definition Sheet, which outlines the following:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div class="doc_flex">
            <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_problem_sheet_01.png" alt="UX Problem Sheet">

          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>In addition, we have refined our new UX service blueprint as shown below:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_service_blueprint.png" alt="Service Blueprint">

        <div class="section_dot"></div>
        <!-- Section 5: Design, Verify & Refine -->
        <div id="section_5_design_verify_n_refine">
          <h6>Design, Verify & Refine</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>Before moving on to the design stage, we defined some simple user stories to guide us.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>As a busy operator, I want to <span class="bold underline">quickly update the production status</span> so that I can <span class="bold underline">focus on a more critical production task</span>.</li>
              <li>As an operating manager, I need to <span class="bold underline">check all the operator’s login data and edit it after the shift</span>.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>And here we come our goal:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li class="bold">Minimising the number of steps and processes</li>
              <li class="bold">Creating a more flexible flow that can adapt to individual user habits</li>
              <li class="bold">Making the digital tool easy to use for users at all levels of digital tool proficiency</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>To achieve these goals, we reconstructed the site map for better navigation.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_sitemap.png" alt="Site Map">
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>These changes will help users with the following:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <p class="underline">1. Better Navigation (Reduce 25% of navigation time)</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_flow_01.png" alt="Better Navigation User Flow">
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p class="underline">2. More flexible for both <span class="bold">real-time reporting</span> and <span class="bold">history review</span> scenarios.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_flow_02.png" alt="More flexible User Flow">
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>To improve communication with team members, we created a wire-flow after having a concrete vision of our design:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_wireflow.jpg" alt="Wireflow">
          <div class="section_dot">&nbsp</div>
          <p>Along the way, we went back and forth with the team members and some of our users to adjust our design, and as a result, we made several changes.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p class="underline bold">1. Replacing Redo Action with Confirm Message:</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>Due to time constraints and technical limitations, and considering that the redo function was not a critical aspect of the project, we decided to replace it with a confirm message. This allowed us to avoid developing a new function that would have minimal use.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_redo_to_comfirm.png" alt="Redo to Comfirm">
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p class="underline bold">2. Streamline the Editing Process:</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>Initially, we were concerned about users accidentally entering edit mode. However, after testing the prototype with users, we discovered that opening edit mode in more than two steps was actually more frustrating for them than the risk of opening it by mistake. Therefore, we simplified the edit flow to make it more efficient and user-friendly.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_streamlime_01.png" alt="Before Streamlime Process">
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_streamlime_02.png" alt="After Streamlime Process">
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p class="underline bold">3. Sense of accomplishment for completing tasks:</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>In our initial design, users could only update the production status. However, after user testing, we discovered that <span class="bold">they viewed updating the status as akin to checking off an item on a to-do list</span>. They wanted a visual confirmation that they had completed the task. Without it, they felt unfulfilled.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>While adding an additional step conflicted with our goal of streamlining the process, we believe that a "finish" button will help to increase engagement and motivation among users.</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <img src="./img/work/case_study/project_02/project_02_sense_of_accomlishment.png" alt="Sense of Accomplishment">
          <div class="section_dot">&nbsp</div>
          <p>And here is our final result:</p>

          <h6>Outcome</h6>
          <div class="t_c"></div>
          <p>Since launching the new version, we've seen substantial improvements, as evidenced by the following metrics:</p>
          <div class="c_b"></div>
          <div>
            <ol>
              <li>Our reporting cycle time has decreased from 45 to just 17 seconds, resulting in a remarkable 62% reduction. <span class="note">(Note: We measure a reporting cycle from status to quality, then status reporting)</span></li>
              <li>Onboarding engagement has increased by 30%, indicating a better user experience.</li>
              <li>User satisfaction has increased from 35% to 71.25%, demonstrating significant progress.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="b_c"></div>
          <p>But we are not finishing…</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>Despite these achievements, we have been questioning whether our product truly adds value for operators, who are using it as part of their job rather than out of spontaneous desire.</p>
          <div class="c_c"></div>
          <p>To ensure we are addressing their needs, we have decided to conduct a five-day design sprint. We will focus on discovering what motivates and interests operators, so we can continue to enhance their experience with our product and make their job easier. And this marks the beginning of our next thrilling journey.</p>
